# RipScout

## Overview  
Welcome to RipScout, the cutting-edge solution for real-time rip current detection and data collection. Utilizing advanced drones equipped with machine learning (ML) technology, RipScout operates independently of an Internet connection, harnessing lightweight ML models optimized for drone controllers' limited computing resources. Our system stands out for its ability to swiftly detect rip currents, hover precisely over the detected area, and collect comprehensive video data from various angles and elevations. 

Designed for ease of use, RipScout empowers even those unfamiliar with rip currents to effectively gather critical data. Field tests confirm that RipScout dramatically enhances data collection speed and accuracy, offering a novel rip current dataset that promises significant advancements in coastal monitoring and safety. With RipScout, we're redefining coastal surveillance and contributing to safer, more informed marine environments.

This repository builds upon the foundational work of [DJI iOS FPV Demo](https://github.com/DJI-Mobile-SDK-Tutorials/iOS-FPVDemo) and [TensorFlow Lite Object Detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/ios).
